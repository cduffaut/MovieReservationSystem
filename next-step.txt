0) Before going further,
We can meliorate by adding some new features in the already existant TABLE/request handler

1) Do not add anything if there is an error in the request on at least one element
Just return an error code, display an error msg, and let the program run

2) New Movie Added:
New features to add (and not forget parsing):
	- Date and hours of diffusion
Need to change:
	- StoreMovie, DeleteMovie
Parse:
	- The date of each session should not be expired
	- No movies should be diffused before 8h30
	- No other movies should be diffused at the same Time
3) New Reservation Made:
New features to add (and not forget parsing):
	- The Date of the session, and the hour
Parse:
	- The date and the session should match with a value in the database

4) Some new (and more complex?) features:
	- adding the duration of the movies in the StoreMovie request
	- by 00H00 no movies should be diffused > StoreMovie should check if 
	hour of diffusion + movie duration should not exced 00h00
	- You should not be able to run 2 movies in the same moment: 
	If a movie is still in diffusion > Another can't be launched 
	(StoreMovie will not add the movie date-hour pair to the database or return an error msg
	and not treat the entire demand)

5) Cancel Reservation:
